This project refines the code from Project 1, facilitating critical section access using semaphores.

To run this program:

1. Download and extract the `.zip` file. 
2. In the command-line interface of your choice, navigate to the `CS3113-Project2` folder. This folder should contain `project2.c`.
3. Enter the command `gcc project2.c -o project2`. This will compile `project2.c` and generate the executable file as `project2`.
4. Finally, run the executable file by entering the command `./project2`.
